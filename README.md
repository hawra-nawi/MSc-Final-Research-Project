Title: Investigating the Relationship Between Disease-Associated SNPs and Proteins Using Coevolution Score Analysis

- This project involved novel in-depth computational biological research to analyse and understand how genetic disease (using SNPs data)
affect the normal state of protein structure using evolution genetic data.
- Huge data analysis was performed, including large data collection (both structured and unstructured), data cleaning
and data transformation, exploratory data analysis.
- Produced the evolution genetic data using scripting languages and biological software tools.
- Performed statistical and network data analysis to assess, critique and visualise the complex state of protein structure.
- The main analysis was performed using R programming language.
